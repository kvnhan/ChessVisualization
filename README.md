Final Project - Interactive Data Visualization  
===

### Project Website

The vis *may* be avaliable [here](http://ashaji.dyn.wpi.edu:5000), but will probably get taken down soon (its hosted on one of our PC's on the WPI network and break is coming up). 

In order to run the vis otherwise `cd` into 'server' and run the following commands:

`source bin/activate` to activate the venv

`python app.py` to start the server.

Once the data is parsed a link is provided to use in your local browser.

### Project Screen-Cast

Avaliable [here]()

TODO 

What do you feel is the best part of your project? 
What insights did you gain? 
What is the single most important thing you would like your audience to take away? Make sure it is front and center rather than at the end.


### Resources

* We scraped the data from chessgames.com.
...The scraped data is avaliable in `server/parsing/data`
* We use d3 for most of our visuals
* We used chess.js for a game engine to help our visualization.


Requirements
---
- Code - All web site files and libraries assuming they are not too big to include
- Data - Include all the data that you used in your project. If the data is too large for github store it on a cloud storage provider, such as Dropbox or Yousendit.
- Process Book- Your Process Book in PDF format.
- README - The README file must give an overview of what you are handing in: which parts are your code, which parts are libraries, and so on. The README must contain URLs to your project websites and screencast videos. The README must also explain any non-obvious features of your interface.


Grading
---

- Process Book - Are you following a design process that is well documented in your process book?
- Solution - Is your visualization effective in answering your intended questions? Was it designed following visualization principles?
- Implementation - What is the quality of your implementation? Is it appropriately polished, robust, and reliable?
- Presentation - Are your web site and screencast clear, engaging, and effective?
Your individual project score will also be influenced by your peer evaluations.
