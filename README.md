Final Project - Interactive Data Visualization  
===

The key learning experience of this course is the final project. 
You will design a web site and interactive visualizations that answer questions you have or provide an exploratory interface to some topic of your own choosing. 
You will acquire the data, design your visualizations, implement them, and critically evaluate the results. 

The path to a good visualization is going to involve mistakes and wrong turns. 
It is therefore important to recognize that mistakes are valuable in finding the path to a solution, to broadly explore the design space, and to iterate designs to improve possible solutions. 
To help you explore the design space, we will hold events such as feedback sessions in which you propose your idea and initial designs and receive feedback from the class and staff.

We will discuss how to form teams as part of the process.
In other words, don't form a team on your own just yet, but rather focus on generating ideas.

Proposal
---

Create a proposal document addressing the following points.
Use the points as headers in your document.

- Basic Info. The project title, your names, e-mail addresses, GitHub ids, a link to the project repository (I encourage you to transfer your work to a public repo after the course).
- Background and Motivation. Discuss your motivations and reasons for choosing this project, especially any background or research interests that may have influenced your decision.
- Project Objectives. Provide the primary questions you are trying to answer with your visualization. What would you like to learn and accomplish? List the benefits.
- Data. From where and how are you collecting your data? If appropriate, provide a link to your data sources.
- Data Processing. Do you expect to do substantial data cleanup? What quantities do you plan to derive from your data? How will data processing be implemented?
- Visualization Design. How will you display your data? Provide some general ideas that you have for the visualization design. Develop three alternative prototype designs for your visualization. Create one final design that incorporates the best of your three designs. Describe your designs and justify your choices of visual encodings. We recommend you use the [Five Design Sheet Methodology](http://fds.design/).
- Must-Have Features. List the features without which you would consider your project to be a failure.
- Optional Features. List the features which you consider to be nice to have, but not critical.
- Project Schedule. Make sure that you plan your work so that you can avoid a big rush right before the final project deadline, and delegate different modules and responsibilities among your team members. Write this in terms of weekly deadlines.
    - Each team member must push this document into his/her homework directory. As a ballpark number: your proposal should contain about 3-4 pages of text, plus 5-6 pages of sketches.

Prototype Presentation & Feedback
---

For this Milestone we expect you to hand in your code and process documentation (see Process Book below) in it’s current state. You don’t have to hand in a screencast and you don’t have to have your website ready.

For your Milestone you should have completed your data acquisition, or at least have a significant sample of your data. You must have your data structures in place. For example, if you plan to collect 1000 data records, but only have 200, that’s fine. If you are missing one of two datasets you want to use you will lose points, since you have to have the whole structure.

You must have a working visualization prototype. You may not have all your views up and running, and it may not be completely interactive, but the direction and the content must be clear.

Final Project Materials
---
For your final project you must hand in the following items.

### Process Book

An important part of your project is your process book. Your process book details your steps in developing your solution, including the alternative designs you tried, and the insights you got. Develop your process book out of the project proposal. Equally important to your final results is how you got there! Your process book is the place you describe and document the space of possibilities you explored at each step of your project. It is not, however, a journal or lab notebook that describes every detail - you should think carefully about the important decisions you made and insights you gained and present your reasoning in a concise way.

We strongly advise you to include many figures in your process book, including photos of your sketches of potential designs, screen shots from different visualization tools you explored, inspirations of visualizations you found online, etc. Several images illustrating changes in your design or focus over time will be far more informative than text describing those changes. Instead, use text to describe the rationale behind the evolution of your project.

Your process book should include the following topics. Depending on your project type the amount of discussion you devote to each of them will vary:

- Overview and Motivation: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.
- Related Work: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, visualizations we discussed in class, etc.
- Questions: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?
- Data: Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: What visualizations did you use to initially look at your data? What insights did you gain? How did these insights inform your design?
- Design Evolution: What are the different visualizations you considered? Justify the design decisions you made using the perceptual and design principles you learned in the course. Did you deviate from your proposal?
- Implementation: Describe the intent and functionality of the interactive visualizations you implemented. Provide clear and well-referenced images showing the key design and interaction elements.
- Evaluation: What did you learn about the data by using your visualizations? How did you answer your questions? How well does your visualization work, and how could you further improve it?

As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail make sure that your process book is a standalone document that fully describes your results and the final design. 
[Here](http://dataviscourse.net/2015/assets/process_books/bansal_cao_hou.pdf) are a [few examples](http://dataviscourse.net/2015/assets/process_books/walsh_trevino_bett.pdf) of process books from a similar course final.

### Project Website

You will create a public website for your project using GitHub pages or any other web hosting service of your choice. 
The web site should contain your interactive visualization, summarize the main results of the project, and tell a story. 
Consider your audience (the site should be public public) and keep the level of discussion at the appropriate level. 
Your process book and data should be linked from the web site as well. 
Also embed your interactive visualization and your screen-cast in your website. 
If you are not able to publish your work (e.g., due to confidential data) please let us know in your project proposal.

### Project Screen-Cast

Each team will create a two minute screen-cast with narration showing a demo of your visualization and/or some slides. 
You can use any [screencast tool](http://dataviscourse.net/2015/screencast/) of your choice -- Camtasia works well. 
Please make sure that the sound quality of your video is good - it may be worthwhile to invest in an external USB microphone. 
Upload the video to an online video-platform such as YouTube or Vimeo and embed it into your project web page. 
We will show some of the best videos in class.

We will strictly enforce the two minute time limit for the video, so please make sure you are not running longer. 
Use principles of good storytelling and presentations to get your key points across. Focus the majority of your screencast on your main contributions rather than on technical details. 
What do you feel is the best part of your project? 
What insights did you gain? 
What is the single most important thing you would like your audience to take away? Make sure it is front and center rather than at the end.

Outside Libraries/References
---

For this project you *do not* have to write everything from scratch.

You may *reference* demo programs from books or the web, and *include* popular web libraries like Bootstrap, JQuery, Backbone, React, Meteor, etcetera. 

Please *do not* use libraries on top of d3, however. Libraries like nvd3.js look tempting, but such libraries often have poor defaults and result in poor visualizations.
Instead, draw from the numerous existing d3 examples on the web.

If you use outside sources please provide a References section with links at the end of your Readme.
